# NeuroSpark Suite

**Liu Cenzhi** · [github.com/mentorkokkwa](https://github.com/mentorkokkwa) · [Repository](https://github.com/amyling/neurospark-suite)

Three connected prototypes I built out of interest in **AI engineering**, **product design**, and **commercial thinking** — focused on how students **learn**, **grow**, and how schools could **serve** with campus robotics.

| Project | Folder | Dev URL | Deploy path |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **EduLens AI** | `edutech/` | http://localhost:3006/edulens | `/edulens` |
| **YouthMentor AI** | `growth/` | http://localhost:3007/youthmentor | `/youthmentor` |
| **CampusBot AI** | `robot/` | http://localhost:3002/campusbot | `/campusbot` |

## Problem → Solution

| Pain point (Singapore students) | Product | Technical highlight |
|--------------------------------|---------|---------------------|
| Homework feedback is slow and generic | EduLens — homework analyzer, lesson generator, mistake book | Multi-provider LLM chain, JSON validation, vision OCR |
| Exam stress; reluctant to seek help early | YouthMentor — mood check-in, reflection, crisis guardrails | Layered safety pipeline, RAG-lite personas, local-first privacy |
| School service robots need safe navigation | CampusBot — map simulator, task planner, metrics report | A* pathfinding, dynamic re-planning, collision detection |

## Quick start (Windows)

Run each command separately (do not chain with `&&`):

```bash
cd edutech
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
cd growth
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
cd robot
npm install
npm run dev
```

Copy `edutech/.env.local.example` → `.env.local` for AI keys. Growth shares the same `EDULENS_*` variables. Without keys, **mock mode** works for demos.

## Safety demo (YouthMentor)

1. Open http://localhost:3007/youthmentor/safety-demo  
2. Click **Run safety demo**  
3. On Reflection → **Get mentor response**  
4. System blocks normal coaching and shows crisis resources only  

Or from home: Demo cases → **High-risk sample (safety demo)**.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, TypeScript  
- **AI:** Provider abstraction (`EDULENS_*`), Gemini / Groq / Ollama / mock fallback  
- **Storage:** Browser `localStorage` (privacy-first, no account required)  
- **Robotics:** Custom A* navigation engine (software simulation)
